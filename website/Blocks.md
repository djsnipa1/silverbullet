Blocks use the fenced code block notation of [[Markdown]], and assign special behavior to it.

The general syntax is:

    ```template-type
    block configuration
    ```

These are the block types that ship with SilverBullet, but [[Plugs]] can define their own:

* `template`: [[Live Templates]]
* `query`: [[Live Queries]]
* `toc`: [[Table of Contents]]
* `embed`: [[Live Embeds]]
* `space-script`: [[Space Script]]
* `space-style`: [[Space Style]]

The fenced code block syntax is also used to get [[Markdown/Syntax Highlighting]] for numerous programming languages.
