Code widgets are a SilverBullet-specific [[Markdown/Extensions|extension]] to [[Markdown]]. Technically, it’s not an extension — it just gives new meaning to markdown’s native fenced code blocks — code blocks that start with a triple backtick, specifying a programming language.

Currently, SilverBullet provides a few code widgets out of the box:

* `toc`: [[Table of Contents]]
* `query`: [[Live Queries]]
* `template`: [[Live Templates]]
* `embed`
* `markdown`

In addition, plugs like [[Plugs/KaTeX]] and [[Plugs/Mermaid]] add additional ones.
