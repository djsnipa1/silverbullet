At the header of each page, you see the currently open page name. Let’s call this user interface element the “Page Namer.” This element of the user interface serves a few roles:

* It indicates the **currently open name** (duh)
* Its font color indicates the current **page status**:
  * Black (in light mode) indicates the page is currently saved
  * Gray (in light mode) indicates the page is currently not saved
* By changing the page name and hitting `Enter` (or clicking/tapping outside of it) you **rename** the [[Pages|page]], automatically updating all references to it as well.
