On this site you see a section “Linked Mentions” appear along the bottom of every page that has incoming links. 👇🏻 This section lists all pages that contain a _link_ to the current page. This allows for easy navigation, and may help you discover linked concepts through these links.

Linked Mentions are not a feature built into SilverBullet directly, but can easily be added by importing the [[Library/Core|core library]].
