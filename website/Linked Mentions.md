Linked Mentions are references from other pages to the current page. Technically, theyâ€™re not a built-in feature, but you can easily implement them using [[Live Template Widgets]].

To enable linked mentions being added to your pages, include the [[template/widget/linked-mentions]] template in your space, either through copy and pasting or through [[Federation]].
