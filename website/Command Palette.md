The Command Palette is used to explore SilverBullet’s numerous [[Commands]] as well as execute them.

The UI and its operation is largely the same as the [[Page Picker]]‘s, with a few differences:

* If a keyboard shortcut is configured for the given command, it is listed along the command name to the right.
* The ordering is decided based on two factors:
  * The last time the command was invoked via the [[Command Palette]] in this client session.
  * The `priority` configured for the command (in the plug, or via [[SETTINGS]] under `shortcuts`).
