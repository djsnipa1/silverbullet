While SilverBullet for sure is aimed at primarily text-based content, life can not fully be represented in text always. Therefore, SilverBullet supports attachments. Attachments, like [[Pages]] ultimately are — once again — just files on disk.

# Uploading
To create an attachment, you have a few options:

* Use the {[Upload: File]} command (especially useful on mobile devices)
* Drag & drop files or images onto a page
* Copy & paste files or images onto a page

All options will prompt you for a file name to use to store the attachment, and then include the attachment as an embedded image (if it was an image) or link to the file.

# Management
SilverBullet [does not currently support](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet/issues/72) any operations like renaming or deleting of attachments. You’ll have to do this outside of SilverBullet somehow.
