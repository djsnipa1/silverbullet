A lot of useful functionality in SilverBullet is implemented through [[Templates]], as well as regular [[Pages]]. Some of these you will create yourself for your own specific use, but many are generic and generally useful. Libraries offer a way to _distribute_ sets of templates and pages easily.

# What’s in a library
Here are some things that a library may provide:
* Various [[Slash Commands]], such as `/today`, `/task`, `/table`.
* Useful [[Page Templates]]
* Useful widgets such as [[Table of Contents]] or [[Linked Mentions]]
* Useful pages that help you perform maintenance on your space, like detecting broken links, such as [[Library/Core/Page/Maintenance]].

# What libraries are on offer?
Libraries are still a young concept in SilverBullet and therefore we’re still exploring how to organize and structure these.

Currently, we have the following libraries available:

* [[Library/Core]]: this is the library you want to import _for sure_. Just do it.
* [[Library/Journal]]: for the journalers among us.
