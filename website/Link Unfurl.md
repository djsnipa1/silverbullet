SilverBullet has infrastructure to “unfurl” — that is: to replace links with something nicer. Unfurling can be triggered by putting your cursor on any “naked” URL (such as https://silverbullet.md), and running the {[Link: Unfurl]} command.

Plugs can provide custom unfurls for specific URL patterns.

Two supported out of the box are:
* A generic URL unfurl, adding a title for a url so `https://silverbullet.md` becomes `[SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md)`.
* A youtube URL unfurl, replacing a Youtube link with an [[Live Embeds]] of that video.
