Commands define actions that SilverBullet can perform. They range from simple edit commands, such as {[Text: Bold]}, but may be more elaborate such as {[Page: Rename]}. 

SilverBullet ships with a lot of commands built in, but custom ones can also be defined using [[Templates]] and [[Plugs]].

Beside the list below, all commands available commands appear in the [[Command Palette]] but may have key bindings as well (these key bindings appear in the [[Command Palette]] and are configurable in [[SETTINGS]]).

# Command list
These are all commands available as well as their Windows/Linux and macOS keybindings (if any):

```query
command
order by name
select name, key, mac
```
