It is a common SilverBullet pattern to give people, groups of people and places dedicated pages so you can easily reference them. It then becomes very convenient to mention these pages elsewhere in your space, and using [[Linked Mentions]] you can easily find what _pages_ link back to that page.

The equivalent of this idea the context of [[Plugs/Tasks]] is Linked Tasks. These are tasks that _mention_ a particular page.

# Example workflow
Let’s say you keep notes of 1-on-1 meetings with people. You have a page for each person where you keep notes for each of your sessions. As you talk to person _A_, something comes up that you need to discuss with person _B_. B _also_ has their own page. What you can do is simply create a task on your note page with _A_ (so you don’t have to context switch) that includes a [[Links|link]] to _B_.

# Example
Below are two tasks that mention this very page (this is not the general pattern, just for demonstration purposes). Note that the not completed task is listed at the top of this page as well in the “Linked Tasks” widget.

* [ ] [[Linked Tasks]] This is a task
* [x] [[Linked Tasks]] This is a completed task
