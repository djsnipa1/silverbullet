Installing SilverBullet as a (local) web server is pretty straightforward if youâ€™re technically inclined enough to be able to use a terminal.

The basic setup is simple: in a terminal, run the silverbullet server process on your machine, then connect to it locally from your browser via `localhost`.

You have two options here:

1. Installation via [[$deno|Deno]] (the awesome JavaScript runtime)
2. Installation via [[$docker|Docker]] (the awesome container runtime)

After choose either, be sure to checkout all [[Install/Configuration]] options as well.
